    <p>
        Bubbles punk  is a new NFT collections of 10,000 bubbles. Each bubbles had its own unique and rare pattern, personality and different style and theme.These Bubbles punk are all transformed from different molecules, so they work with great bond one with another.

        10,000 unique collectible characters with proof of ownership stored on the Ethereum blockchain. The project that inspired the modern Sharprod team. 




The Bubbles punks  are 10,000 uniquely generated molecules. No two are exactly alike there most be a slight differences in them, and each one of them can be officially owned by a single person on the Ethereum blockchain. Originally, they could be claimed for free by anybody with an Ethereum wallet, but all 10,000 were quickly claimed.

    <h2>Origin Of Bubbles PUNK </h2>
    <p>
        On a faithful day we came to discover that molecules weren't together, they are lived seperately, They could form many things by themself weren't living together

However, on a faithful day we decised to work it out by to work together in unity in bond, and this bond helped them achieve many things in metaverse.


 So therefore it is a Unique/Rare collectible characters stored on the Eth/Poly  Blockchain,<a href="https://discord.gg/9Cpg7jY4">Discord</a> (Bubbles punk is a bond of nfts they work things out togetherï¼‰

    <h2>Creative Concept</h2>
    <p>
        The concept  comes from a molecules that weren't together in a chemistry, but are now together in bond and making impart in the metaverse. We hope to appeal to everyone that is bond will be the  best bond together.
